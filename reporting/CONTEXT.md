# Reporting Workspace — ReDefine You

## What This Is

Call center reporting dashboard for ReDefine You's in-house setter team.
Tracks dials, pickups, conversations, appointments booked, shows, no-shows,
and cost metrics across all lead sources.

**Data pipeline:** GHL → Make.com → Railway (Next.js) → Supabase → Dashboard

## Status: Not Yet Set Up

The code is ready. The following steps need to be completed before going live.

## Setup Checklist

### 1. Create Supabase Project
- Go to supabase.com → New Project
- Copy: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- Run `tracking-app/supabase/schema.sql` in the SQL editor
- **Increase max rows:** supabase.com → project → Settings → API → Max Rows → set to `100000`
  (default is 1000 — dashboard will show all zeros without this)

### 2. Deploy to Railway
- Push `tracking-app/` to a new GitHub repo
- Connect Railway → deploy from that repo
- Set all environment variables (see `.env.local.example`)
- Note the Railway URL (e.g. `redefine-you-production.up.railway.app`)

### 3. Import Make Blueprints
- In Make.com, create a folder called "ReDefine You Reporting"
- Import each blueprint from `make-blueprints/` (skip `ccm-agent-claim`)
- Add a webhook to each scenario, copy the URLs

### 4. Set Up GHL Workflows
- New Lead → New Lead webhook URL
- Appointment Booked → Appt Booked webhook URL
- Appointment Showed → Show webhook URL
- Appointment No Showed → No Show webhook URL
- Call Ended (outbound) → Dial webhook URL
- Callback Booked → Callback webhook URL

### 5. Add First "Client"
- Log into the dashboard → Settings → add first client
- For ReDefine You, clients = lead sources or service lines
  e.g. "Botox", "Weight Loss", "Skin Treatments"
- The `client_name` in Make must match exactly

### 6. Test End to End
- Trigger a real GHL event
- Check Supabase Table Editor → events table
- Confirm it appears on the dashboard
